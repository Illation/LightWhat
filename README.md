to run start LightWhat.exe

* press "L" to load a collada (*.dae) file 
* press "T" to load a test scene with spheres and a plane 
* press "C" to clear the current scene 
* press "ENTER" / "RETURN" to start rendering 
* press "S" to save your result as a bitmap (*.bmp)

* press "B" to toggle backface culling on and off
* press "D" to display the first texture in the list, or a test texture if no images where loaded

note: scenes do not clear automatically, so before you load a different scene or file, press "C" to clear it

* you can try the models from the TestFiles folder.
* you can also try rendering your own models by exporting them in collada or 3Ds format.  
* You might want to position your models so that they are visible from the camera as there is no way of changing its position at the moment 

if you find any bugs tell me about them please

Have fun!
